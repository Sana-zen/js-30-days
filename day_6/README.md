# Day 6: Color Flipper

## Description

A simple web application built as part of the JavaScript 30 Days challenge. This project creates a color flipper that generates and applies random hex colors to the page background upon clicking a button. The app ensures that each new color is different from the previous one to provide a varied experience.

## Features

- **Random Hex Color Generation**: Generates a random 6-digit hexadecimal color code.
- **Dynamic Background Change**: Updates the page background color instantly on button click.
- **Color Display**: Shows the current background color code in the UI.
- **Title Color Sync**: Changes the navigation title color to match the new background color.
- **No Repeat Colors**: Prevents the same color from being selected consecutively.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including custom fonts (Roboto and Open Sans), responsive layout, and button hover effects.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For the logic to generate random colors and handle user interactions.
