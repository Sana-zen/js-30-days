# Day 5 - Quote Generator

## What I built:
 
 - I built a quote generator app Where The user can click a **NEW QUOTE** button to generate a new quote on the UI.
 - I added five quotes that cycle one by one until the final quote, after which the sequence resets.
 - I haven't focused on building the UI manually. Since My primary goal was learning javaScript, I used AI to generate the UI and implemented the logic on my own to save time.

 ## Features
 - Generate a new quote on button click

## Concepts Used
- Array
- Event handling
