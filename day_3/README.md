# Day 3 - Learned DOM, Events Basics 

## Today I learned:

- How to add and remove nodes from DOM using appendChild() and removeChild() method.
- How the navigator, window, and Document work. I learned to use navigator.userAgent, navigator.innerWidth, navigator.location, location etc.
- How to add attribute in HTML using JavaScript with setAttribute() method.
- How the addEventListener Method Works: I learned events like click, input, mouseover, DOMContentLoaded and more. 
- How to add style in JS using element.style.property. How to add class one or multiple using classList.
- Learned about setTimeout() and setInterval methods. 
- What Is the requestAnimationFrame() API, and How Can It Be Used. Though, I didn't get the hang of this. Didn't understand enough. Going to explore it more.

## What I Did Practically
- Created and removed DOM elements dynamically using JavaScript
- Added event listeners to respond to user interactions
- Modified styles and classes using JavaScript
- Used timers to control UI behavior
