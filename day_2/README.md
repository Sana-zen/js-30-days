# Day 2 - Learned DOM Basics.

## Today I learned:
- `document.getElementById()`: to select an element using it's id. 
- `document.querySelector()`: to select the first element that matches the given CSS selector.
- `document.querySelectorAll()`: to select all the elements that match a CSS selector (id, class, tag, or attribute).
- How to loop over NodeLists and apply changes to multiple elements.
- How to change text and styles of elements using JavaScript.
- `CreateElement()`: Learned how to create dynamic html elements. I created a `img` tag. And added that into `box` using `appendChild()`.
- Learned about InnerHTMl and why it should be used carefully due to security risks.
