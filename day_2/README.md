# Day 2: Learning DOM

Day 2 focuses on selecting DOM elements using different selectors and modifying their content and styles.

## What I Learned
- **DOM Selection Methods**:
  - `document.getElementById(id)`: Selects an element by its ID (e.g., "container", "profile")
  - `document.querySelector(selector)`: Selects the first element matching a CSS selector (e.g., "section", "div", ".highlight")
  - `document.querySelectorAll(selector)`: Returns a NodeList of all matching elements (e.g., all "div" elements)
- **Console Logging**: Using `console.log()` to inspect and debug DOM elements
- **Selector Types**: ID selectors are faster and more specific than class or tag selectors
- **DOM Manipulation**: Changing text content and applying inline styles to elements
- **Working with NodeLists**: Accessing elements by index, getting length, and looping to apply changes
